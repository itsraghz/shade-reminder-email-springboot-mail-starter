# Things to Do

## Must Have
1. (*) Externalize all the values
    * From email
    * To Recipients
    * SMTP properties etc.,
2. Add the placeholder for YYYY-MMM in the Shade Reminder Email.   
3. Bring some dynamism on the test emails  with a placeholder for a random number or YYYYMMDDHHMMSS or 
   something similar - in the Email Subject and/or Body.
   
## Nice to have

1. Verify the emails sent via IMAP Protocol using JavaMail API - Unit Testing
