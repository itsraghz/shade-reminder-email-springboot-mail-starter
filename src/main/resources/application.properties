<span style=\"font-family:Calibri; font-color:navy;\ font-size:14px;">\
  Dear Friends,<br/>\
<br/>\
We have a very timely appeal for supporting the family of <b>Felix Lourdu Raj</b> who was my Diploma Classmate \
25 years ago, and he passed away a month ago due to the COVID pandemic :( Infact, his family had two deaths in a row \
during May 2021 - one my friend Felix and another his sister in law. <br/><br/>\
<span style=\"background-color:yellow;color:black;\">\
<b>Appeal Summary</b><br/>\
</span><br/>\
  <span style=\"font-family:Consolas;font-size:13px;color:purple;\"> \
Dear Friends, <br/><br/>\
  With a heavy heart, having lost a very good friend of mine - <b>Mr Felix Lourdu Raj</b> last month due to COVID, \  \
  appeal to you all for the welfare of the family - as he was survived by his wife and a 7 year old son - who is a special \
 child. I always remember Felix as a very calm and composed, a humble and simple human being. His wife Mrs Sagaya Mary, \
 who has not seen the outside world much is now totally in a shock and helpless state. She is still busy with the formalities \
  associated with the Death Certificate, Insurance Claim etc., where mostly she was not aware till date of the policies any. \
  <br/><br/>\
 We, the batch  mates of <b>DECE 1999</b> in <b>Alagappa Polytechnic</b> wanted to jointly run this fundraising campaign with \
 <b>SHaDE</b> for the welfare of his family - mainly towards his son's medical expenses and education. I would sincerely request \
 you all to join hands and help my friend's family. <br/>\
