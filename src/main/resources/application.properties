<span style=\"font-family:Calibri; font-color:navy;\ font-size:14px;">\
  Dear Friends,<br/>\
<br/>\
We have an important and interesting appeal for the social cause. It is called <b>Tha<u>VARAM</u></b> - \
  meaning a Plant in Tamil Language, where the word VARAM is emphasized in all caps that has a \
  different meaning - which means a <b>boon</b> in Tamil. \ This is just one of many different beauties of Tamil Language :) \
  <br/><br/> \
   ThaVARAM ==> Every Tree is a boon in our life, which of course is an undeniable fact! \
  <br/><br/> \
<span style=\"background-color:yellow;color:black;\">\
<b>Appeal Summary</b><br/>\
</span><br/>\
  <span style=\"font-family:Consolas;font-size:13px;color:purple;\"> \
    It is a longstanding wish and mission of SHaDE Team, to do an useful thing for the society and the next generation, \
  and we have the right moment now, which was offered by my dear friend and a SHaDE Volunteer - <b>SathishKumar Thiyagarajan T</b>\
  (SG0069), who has shown a great interest and taken a lead to start this activity with his like minded friends and volunteers, in and  \
  around the district located in the southern side of TamilNadu state (TN) - <i>Ramanathapuram</i> to start with, \
  and to gradually expand in the near by districts like <i>Madurai</i>, <i>Tiruchirappalli</i> etc., with the help of the students in the \
  Government schools (at the place called <b>Irumeni</b> to begin with), and a <u><i>few subject matter experts turned passionate volunteers</u></i> \
  in the crew. \
  <br/><br/>\
  We, from SHaDE are very proud to officially sponsor this event at the maximum possible, along with our members and well wishers, \
  whom we trust and rely on for the best possible support, as always. \
  <br/><br/> \
  The initial talks were in Sep 2021, where we had completely sponsored the T-shirts on our own (without any fund raising) \
  with the SHaDE Logo (around 105 T Shirts), which we want to distribute the students and other volunteers who take part in the tree planting event. \
  The customized T-shirts with the SHaDE Logo (front and back) for 105 numbers for Rs 11,000/- and we got them printed through our other good friend \
  in Tirupur, who helped us get it at a good quality with an affordable price. \
  An Appeal (<a href='http://shade.org.in/appeal/viewAppealTxInfo.php?appealId=169'>Appeal #169 - ThaVARAM - TShirts for the TreePlantingEvent</a>) \
  has been created for the same. \
  <br/><br/> \
  Now, for the month of our target is to <b>plant 1000 saplings in this October 2021 month</b> - with a <b>proper fence</b> to protect the saplings. \
  Roughly one Unit (Sapling breed + Fence) costs Rs 250 to Rs 300 (varies based on the breed) for the estimation of expenses. \
  <br/><br/> \
  We have attached a few artifacts - the customized T-shirts with SHaDE Logo, video related to the sapling planting, and a few sample planting images by \
  the volunteer team for your kind perusal. See below for the links for the images and videos in our Google Drive.\
