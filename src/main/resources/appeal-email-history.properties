Dear Raghavan Anna,\
<br/><br/>\
Hope all are doing good.<br/><br/> I kindly request you to help us get the sponsorship for the underprivileged children studying in our \

  Dear Friends,<br/>\
<br/>\
We have a very timely appeal for supporting the family of <b>Felix Lourdu Raj</b> who was my Diploma Classmate \
25 years ago, and he passed away a month ago due to the COVID pandemic :( Infact, his family had two deaths in a row \
during May 2021 - one my friend Felix and another his sister in law. <br/><br/>\

Dear Friends, <br/><br/>\
  With a heavy heart, having lost a very good friend of mine - <b>Mr Felix Lourdu Raj</b> last month due to COVID, \  \
  appeal to you all for the welfare of the family - as he was survived by his wife and a 7 year old son - who is a special \
 child. I always remember Felix as a very calm and composed, a humble and simple human being. His wife Mrs Sagaya Mary, \
 who has not seen the outside world much is now totally in a shock and helpless state. She is still busy with the formalities \
  associated with the Death Certificate, Insurance Claim etc., where mostly she was not aware till date of the policies any. \

  Dear Friends,<br/>\
<br/>\
We have another appeal for a 5 Year old child Master Piyush who has to undergo a \
  chemotherapy for his AML (Acute Myraid Lukemia) - Blood Caner.<br/><br/>\
<span style=\"background-color:yellow;color:black;\">\
<b>Appeal Summary</b><br/>\
</span><br/>\
  <span style=\"font-family:Consolas;font-size:13px;color:purple;\"> \
    5 years old Piyush has no idea what is happening around him. \
  Doctors, nurses and overcrowded place of AIIMS, Delhi makes no sense to him but he is now used to it. \
  His parents try to keep him happy; in return Piyush tries to forget his pain due to blood cancer \
  (Acute Myeloid Leukemia). In medical terms, AML is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow \
  with excess immature white blood cells. Piyush feels tired most of the times and fever makes him \
  weaker. His father being a worker in a printing press, has no savings or financial sources to pay \
  the treatment cost of INR 3Lakhs. National NGO (NOSE) stands firm with Piyush and providing all the \
  possible support. We need your support in saving Piyush\?s life. We believe together we can make a change.\

  Dear Friends,<br/>\
<br/>\
We have an important and interesting appeal for the social cause. It is called <b>Tha<u>VARAM</u></b> - \
  meaning a Plant in Tamil Language, where the word VARAM is emphasized in all caps that has a \
  different meaning - which means a <b>boon</b> in Tamil. \ This is just one of many different beauties of Tamil Language :) \
  <br/><br/> \
   ThaVARAM ==> Every Tree is a boon in our life, which of course is an undeniable fact! \
  <br/><br/> \
<span style=\"background-color:yellow;color:black;\">\
<b>Appeal Summary</b><br/>\
</span><br/>\
  <span style=\"font-family:Consolas;font-size:13px;color:purple;\"> \
    It is a longstanding wish and mission of SHaDE Team, to do an useful thing for the society and the next generation, \
  and we have the right moment now, which was offered by my dear friend and a SHaDE Volunteer - <b>SathishKumar Thiyagarajan T</b>\
  (SG0069), who has shown a great interest and taken a lead to start this activity with his like minded friends and volunteers, in and  \
  around the district located in the southern side of TamilNadu state (TN) - <i>Ramanathapuram</i> to start with, \
  and to gradually expand in the near by districts like <i>Madurai</i>, <i>Tiruchirappalli</i> etc., with the help of the students in the \
  Government schools (at the place called <b>Irumeni</b> to begin with), and a <u><i>few subject matter experts turned passionate volunteers</u></i> \
  in the crew. \
  <br/><br/>\
  We, from SHaDE are very proud to officially sponsor this event at the maximum possible, along with our members and well wishers, \
  whom we trust and rely on for the best possible support, as always. \
  <br/><br/> \
  The initial talks were in Sep 2021, where we had completely sponsored the T-shirts on our own (without any fund raising) \
  with the SHaDE Logo (around 105 T Shirts), which we want to distribute the students and other volunteers who take part in the tree planting event. \
  The customized T-shirts with the SHaDE Logo (front and back) for 105 numbers for Rs 11,000/- and we got them printed through our other good friend \
  in Tirupur, who helped us get it at a good quality with an affordable price. \
  An Appeal (<a href='http://shade.org.in/appeal/viewAppealTxInfo.php?appealId=169'>Appeal #169 - ThaVARAM - TShirts for the TreePlantingEvent</a>) \
  has been created for the same. \
  <br/><br/> \
  Now, for the month of our target is to <b>plant 1000 saplings in this October 2021 month</b> - with a <b>proper fence</b> to protect the saplings. \
  Roughly one Unit (Sapling breed + Fence) costs Rs 250 to Rs 300 (varies based on the breed) for the estimation of expenses. \
  <br/><br/> \
  We have attached a few artifacts - the customized T-shirts with SHaDE Logo, video related to the sapling planting, and a few sample planting images by \
  the volunteer team for your kind perusal. See below for the links for the images and videos in our Google Drive.\

  Dear Friends,<br/>\
<br/>\
  We have a very genuine and critical appeal to save a 6 months old baby Vandhana, for a heart surgery to be performed at \
  Sri Ramakrishna Hospitals, Coimbatore, Tamilnadu. <br/>\
  This appeal was brought to us by one of our long time SHaDE members - \
  <b>Sreesathiyapriya Thangavel (SG0735)</b>, as the baby\'s mother Renuga is her neighbor in Coimbatore. \
  <br/><br/> \
<span style=\"background-color:yellow;color:black;\">\
<b>Appeal Summary</b><br/>\
</span><br/>\
  <span style=\"font-family:Consolas;font-size:13px;color:purple;\"> \
  Hi SHADE Team,\
<br/><br/>\
Hope everyone is doing good. I have submitted an appeal on behalf of my friend Renu, \
  who has recently delivered a twin children and one of them (a girl child) of 6 months \
  is suffering from the heart disease and the surgery cost would be around Rs 2 Lacs INR \
  @ Sri Ramakrishna Hospital, Coimbatore.\
<br/><br/>\
Out of the 3 holes in her heart, 2 were of 3 mm thickness and 1 was of 5 mm thickness. \
  The 2 holes of 3mm were closed naturally but the 5mm one has been growing wider \
  alongside the mixture of pure and impure blood vessels that causes a suffocation to the baby at times!\
<br/><br/>\
Vandhana\'s parents are from a middle class background. Her father is working in private \
  company and mother is a house wife. Her parents managed to arrange some funds \
  on their own (savings and pledging jewels etc.,) for the diagnosis and the initial treatment. \
<br/><br/>\
I have attached all the documents and submit the appeal form online for SHaDE. \
  Request you to kindly help the new born baby/child have a normal life along with \
  her twin sibling, who is eagerly waiting for her to join hands in their play.\

  Dear Friends,<br/>\
<br/>\
  We have a very genuine and urgent appeal to help the baby of Jalajakshi - <b>Baby Rithika</b>, aged <b>6 months</b>, \
  who was born as a mixed twin (other baby was a boy and doing great), but \
  unfortunately this girl has been suffering from congenital heart defects like CCTGA \
  (Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries) along with \
  VSD (Ventricular Septal Defect) and large PDA (Patent Ductus Arteriosus). <br/>\
<br/>\
  <b>PDA : </b> The PDA is a persistent opening between the two major blood vessels leading from the heart. \
  The opening (ductus arteriosus) is a normal part of a baby's circulatory system in the womb that usually closes \
  shortly after birth. If it remains open, it's called a patent ductus arteriosus. \
  Click <a href=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/patent-ductus-arteriosus/symptoms-causes/syc-20376145>here</a> \
  to know more about the PDA. <br/>\

  I personally know Jalajakshi, who had been working with me for about a year, and I vouch the \
  authenticity of this appeal.\

  Dear Friends,<br/>\
<br/>\
  We have a very genuine and urgent appeal to help the baby of Jalajakshi - <b>Baby Rithika</b>, aged <b>6 months</b>, \
  who was born as a mixed twin (other baby was a boy and doing great), but \
  unfortunately this girl has been suffering from congenital heart defects like CCTGA \
  (Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries) along with \
  VSD (Ventricular Septal Defect) and large PDA (Patent Ductus Arteriosus). <br/>\
<br/>\
  <b>PDA : </b> The PDA is a persistent opening between the two major blood vessels leading from the heart. \
  The opening (ductus arteriosus) is a normal part of a baby's circulatory system in the womb that usually closes \
  shortly after birth. If it remains open, it's called a patent ductus arteriosus. \
  Click <a href=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/patent-ductus-arteriosus/symptoms-causes/syc-20376145>here</a> \
  to know more about the PDA. <br/>\
<br/>\
  I personally know Jalajakshi, who had been working with me for about a year, and I vouch the \
  authenticity of this appeal.\

We have a recurring appeal to support the genuinely deserving students of \
<b><a href=\"http://arungaraiamman.co.in/\">Sri Arungarai Amman Nallathaai Vidyalayam</a></b>, \
Udumalpet Taluk, Coimbatore District, TamilNadu, whom we had been supporting since the year 2019 \

<b>Appeal Summary</b><br/>\
</span><br/>\
  <span style=\"font-family:Consolas;font-size:13px;color:purple;\">\
Dear Raghavan Anna,\
<br/><br/>\
Hope all are doing good.<br/><br/> I kindly request you to help us get the sponsorship for the underprivileged children studying in our \
school for this academic year also. \
I am attaching the list of students who are in need. Few of them are single parental, few of their parents are financially suffering. \
Through education, we can bring a good change in their life. So we would work again as a team to do our best to transform these students \
 as responsible citizens. <br/> <br/>For your information, school fee is same Rs.9000/- for this academic year also for all the standards \
from Class I to X. Looking forward for all your support.\
  <br/><br/>\
With regards,<br/>\
Hema. \
